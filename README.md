#School_District_Analysis
We have been analyzing data regarding standardized scores and funding for a school system so that the district may determine how to distribute future funds. As such, we have compared school types against their funding and test scores - resulting in the creation of various tables depicting the relevant information.

##Overview 
It was brought to our attention that some degree of academic dishonesty occurred in the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. As a result, it was determined that this data should be removed from the final analysis. We have since taken the steps necessary to properly analyze the data without those particular ninth graders.

##Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

    - How is the district summary affected?
    
    - How is the school summary affected?
    
    - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High   School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    
    - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    - Math and reading scores by grade
