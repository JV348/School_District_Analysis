# School_District_Analysis
We have been analyzing data regarding standardized scores and funding for a school system so that the district may determine how to distribute future funds. As such, we have compared school types against their funding and test scores - resulting in the creation of various tables depicting the relevant information.

## Overview 
It was brought to our attention that some degree of academic dishonesty occurred in the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. As a result, it was determined that this data should be removed from the final analysis. We have since taken the steps necessary to properly analyze the data without those particular ninth graders.

## Results

    - How is the district summary affected?
